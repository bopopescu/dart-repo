Total: a spreadsheet app written in Dart

Building and running:

1. go to the total sample directory:

  $ cd dart/samples/total


2. build and run the environment:

  $ ./bin/start-total &

  This will build the dart binaries if needed, so the first time
  you run this step, it may take a few minutes.


3. open the generated file in a browser:
  $ google-chrome http://localhost:9090/Total.html

If you are using a dart-enabled browser, the dart source will be
served up.  Otherwise, the server will compile the Dart source to
javascript using the frog compiler each time the page is re-loaded.
