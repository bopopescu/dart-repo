This directory contains two experimental ideas. They both introduce an
abstraction layer on top of isolates and futures to help make the code more
oblivious of the underlying isolate architecture.

  promise.dart - contains an old example that was based on Promise<T> (an
                 earlier prototype of Future<T>). Tests based on this code under
                 'sample/tests/proxy' serve as an illustration of how promise
                 pipelining could look like.

  proxy.dart - contains an RPC layer that sits on top of isolates and futures.
               It provides base classes to define client and server rpc stubs.
               The test 'sample/tests/proxy/MintMakerRpcTest' illustrates how
               this can be used.
