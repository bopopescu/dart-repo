This directory contains sample Dart programs using the draft WebComponents
features specified here:

https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/explainer/index.html
https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/shadow/index.html

as well as the new <style scoped> tag. As such, these samples currently only
run on Dartium with the command-line flags --enable-shadow-dom and
--enable-style-scoped set. Chrome Canary with the same command-line flags will
run them when they are compiled with dart2js.
