/***
 * Background:
 *
 * There are two "target" classes here that are the actual implementation
 * of some service that performs some function.  These "target" classes
 * do not know about ports, isolates or rpc.  They expose a local (usually
 * synchronous) interface to perform some task.  In this example, the "target"
 * classes are very simple:
 *
 *    Mint - creates new Purse objects with an initial amount of money
 *    Purse - holds an amount of money, and supports making deposits
 *        by taking money out of another purse.
 *
 * The point of this example is to show how to create a new Dart isolate
 * and run Mint and Purse objects in that isolate, and communicate with
 * these objects with a SendPort/ReceivePort message/reply conversation,
 * where command arguments are marshalled and unmarshalled by RpcProxy and
 * RpcReceiver objects.
 *
 * This example also shows:
 *     1. how the messages in the conversation can refer to target
 *          objects besides the direct recipient of the message
 *     2. how target objects can throw exceptions and these are propagated back
 *          through the SendPort/ReceivePort channel and back to the Future
 *          object that is waiting for the reply.
 *
 * Classes:
 *
 *    Mint - used to create Purse objects
 *    Purse - holds a bank balance, supports depositing money from another Purse
 *    MintReceiver - listens on a ReceivePort and forwards commands to Mint
 *    PurseReceiver - listens on a ReceivePort and forwards commands to Purse
 *    MintProxy - sends commands to a SendPort (which is connected to a
 *        MintReceiver)
 *    PurseProxy - sends commands to a SendPort (which is connected to a
 *        PurseReceiver)
 *    MintIsolate - used to spawn a new Isolate and return the initial MintProxy
 *
 * Base classes used: (these are defined in proxy.dart)
 *    RpcReceiver - MintReceiver and PurseReceiver derive from RpcReceiver to
 *         get behavior common to all Receivers.
 *    RpcProxy - MintProxy and PurseProxy derive from RpcProxy to get behavior
 *         common to all proxies
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * We make a "receiver" object (MintReceiver and PurseReceiver) for each
 * target object that is being exposed.  Each "receiver" object gets
 * its own ReceivePort, where it listen for messages that it interprets
 * as commands for its target object.
 *
 * When a command is received by a receiver, the receiver calls the appropriate
 * method on the the target object.  The receiver object runs in the same
 * isolate as its target object.  This isolate is called the "service" isolate.
 *
 * RpcProxy objects run in the "client" isolate.  Each proxy object has a
 * SendPort which is connected to the ReceivePort of a corresponding receiver
 * object.
 *
 * So, a MintProxy object (running in the "client" isolate) is connected
 * to a MintReceiver object (running in the "service" isolate) which is
 * connected to a Mint target object (also running in the "service" isolate).
 *
 * Startup/Shutdown:
 *
 * The MintIsolate has a method open that spawns a new isolate and returns
 * a MintProxy object.
 *
 * To shut down the MintIsolate, call 'close' on the MintProxy object.  This
 * will close all receive ports of all receivers in the isolate, which will
 * cause the mint isolate to shutdown.
